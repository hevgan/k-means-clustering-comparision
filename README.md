# k-means-clustering-comparision 


### The Python script visualizes how [k-means algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) works, depending on the chosen number of centroid points and the type of distance metric.
</br>

## Available distance metric types:

* Chebyshev
* Euclidean
* Manhattan
* Minkowski
</br>
